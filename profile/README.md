Welcome to the AISviz project! ðŸ‘‹

We are a research initiative conducted by [MERIDIAN](https://meridian.cs.dal.ca) (Marine Environmental Research Infrastructure for Data Integration and Application Network) at *Dalhousie University* and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) of the *Government of Canada*. This project aims to facilitate using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for marine vessel tracking to enhance our understanding of global maritime traffic and the impacts of vessel activity on marine ecosystems.

## Goals

Our main objective is to build an easy-to-use open-source toolbox for raw AIS data extraction, processing, visualization, and vessel modeling. We are targeting accessibility, comprehension, and ease of use for a broad spectrum of users that ranges from government bodies and policymakers to university researchers, NGOs, coastal communities, and the general public. 

## Contributions

Through AISviz, we aim to open new pathways of research and policy-making strategies related to environmental preservation, vessel traffic optimization, illegal fishing detection, aquatic invasive species prevention, noise pollution monitoring, and much more. 
Moreover, AISviz would equip anyone interested in understanding the patterns and impacts of vessel movement with the necessary tools and knowledge to do so. Even if you're just an enthusiast, educator, student, or concerned citizen, AISviz can help you grasp the crucial role of vessel traffic in shaping our world's oceans.

## Collaborations
This project is born out of active collaboration, and we're ready to widen our circle. Regardless of your background, if you are interested in AIS data, marine conservation or wish to contribute to our code -- you are most welcome!
We'd love to hear from you. If you have questions or suggestions or want to chat about AIS and ocean conservation, feel free to connect with us.

*Let's set sail together on a voyage of discovery and stewardship for our precious oceans.*
